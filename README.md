Climate history and possible futures showing your important life events

#### Data from:

Â© SSP Public Database (Version 2.0) https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/SspDb  
NASA's GISS historical data https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/

## Important details

NASA's GISS historical data uses a baseline of 1951-1980. The SSP scenarios, which get temperature results from the MAGICC model, use a baseline of 1980-1999. Since the baselines don't match I modify the SSP results to equal GISS in 20200.

Rather than showing all of the SSP climate scenarios (e.g. Baseline, 1.9, 2.6, 3.4, etc) I combine them into *High*, *Med*, and *Low* groups. This helps make the figure cleaner and avoids the need to explain different end-point scenarios in terms of radiative forcing.
